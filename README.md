Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree Capstone Projects

Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree program has 2 Terms. I have opted directly for Term 2 after doing self-study on Lessons in Term 1.

Term 2 has three Capstone Projects:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: This Capstone project has Exploratory Analysis on the Udacity's Curated Dataset named "Red Wine Quality".

2. Data Wrangling: This Capstone project has wrangling efforts on Publicly available twitter account - "WeRateDogs". This project also has thoughtful insights drawn from the wrangled data.

3. Data Story Telling: This Capstone project has Tableau Story (Explanatory Data Visualization) Narration on Udacity's Curated Dataset named "Baseball Data".
